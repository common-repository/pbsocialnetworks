= Open Graph protocol =

“The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph. For instance, this is used on Facebook to allow any web page to have the same functionality as any other object on Facebook.” ([opengraphprotocol.org](http://opengraphprotocol.org/)).

pbSocialNetworks Pro has an extensive support for the most used Open Graph Metadata and a lot more. You can set up your Open Graph Metadata for the whole site and specify it in each Article or Page.
With Open Graph you get a better visibility in Social Networks like Facebook as other Websites without Open Graph.

pbSocialNetworks Pro has a two Part Statistics System: The fist Part tracks all Traffic you receive by Social Networks like Facebook, Google+ and Twitter.
The second Part tracks only visitors who come over links by the Social Buttons like Facebook like, Google +1 or a Tweet by the Tweet Button.
With this two Channel System you can easily track your Social Media Campaigns and the Activity of your Users with the Social Button Tracking.

The Plugin itself is fully Multilanguage compatible and supports english and german. If you need more languages you can easily translate it yourself with the .po files ([PoEdit](http://www.poedit.net/)).
